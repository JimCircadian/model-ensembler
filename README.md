# HPC Batcher

## Introduction

The purpose of this utility is to act as a controller for huge batches of jobs that are constrained from running or being submitted to an HPC. Rather than relying on the user to submit jobs when they have processing space on the HPC, one may batch together definitions and criterion for their execution, allowing this simple utility to manage the rest.
